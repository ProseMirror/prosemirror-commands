## 1.1.4 (2020-04-15)

### Bug fixes

`selectNodeForward` and `selectNodeBackward` will now also select nodes next to a gap cursor (or other custom empty selection type).

## 1.1.3 (2020-01-03)

### Bug fixes

Fix an issue where, since version 1.7.4 of prosemirror-model, `splitBlock` fails to create the expected new textblock in some schemas.

## 1.1.2 (2019-11-20)

### Bug fixes

Rename ES module files to use a .js extension, since Webpack gets confused by .mjs

## 1.1.1 (2019-11-19)

### Bug fixes

The file referred to in the package's `module` field now is compiled down to ES5.

## 1.1.0 (2019-11-08)

### New features

Add a `module` field to package json file.

## 1.0.8 (2019-05-14)

### Bug fixes

Fix a crash caused by using a position potentially outside the document in [`splitBlock`](https://prosemirror.net/docs/ref/#commands.splitBlock).

## 1.0.7 (2018-04-09)

### Bug fixes

Fixes an issue where [`joinBackward`](https://prosemirror.net/docs/ref/#commands.joinBackward) might create a selection pointing into the old document.

## 1.0.6 (2018-04-04)

### Bug fixes

The [`setBlockType` command](https://prosemirror.net/docs/ref/#commands.setBlockType) command is now considered applicable when _any_ of the selected textblocks can be changed (it used to only look at the first one).

Fix crash when calling [`splitBlock`](https://prosemirror.net/docs/ref/#commands.splitBlock) when the selection isn't in a block node (by disabling the command in that case).

Fixes an issue where [`joinForward`](https://prosemirror.net/docs/ref/#commands.joinForward) might create a selection pointing into the old document.

## 1.0.5 (2018-01-30)

### Bug fixes

Fix crash in [`splitBlock`](https://prosemirror.net/docs/ref/#commands.splitBlock) when `defaultContentType` returns null.

## 1.0.4 (2018-01-18)

### Bug fixes

Pressing delete in front of an [isolating](https://prosemirror.net/docs/ref/#model.NodeSpec.isolating) node no longer opens it.

## 1.0.3 (2017-12-19)

### Bug fixes

Fix issue where [`joinBackward`](https://prosemirror.net/docs/ref/#commands.joinBackward) would sometimes create an invalid selection.

## 1.0.2 (2017-11-21)

### Bug fixes

[`splitBlock`](https://prosemirror.net/docs/ref/#commands.splitBlock) no longer crashes when used in a block that's it's parent node's only allowed child.

## 1.0.0 (2017-10-13)

### New features

The [`setBlockType` command](https://prosemirror.net/docs/ref/#commands.setBlockType) can now be used to change the types of multiple selected textblocks (rather than only one).

The platform-dependent versions of the [base keymap](https://prosemirror.net/docs/ref/#commands.baseKeymap) are now exported separately as [`pcBaseKeymap`](https://prosemirror.net/docs/ref/#commands.pcBaseKeymap) and [`macBaseKeymap`](https://prosemirror.net/docs/ref/#commands.macBaseKeymap).

## 0.23.0 (2017-09-13)

### Breaking changes

`joinForward` and `joinBackward` no longer fall back to selecting the next node when no other behavior is possible. There are now separate commands `selectNodeForward` and `selectNodeBackward` that do this, which the base keymap binds as fallback behavior.

[`baseKeymap`](https://prosemirror.net/docs/ref/version/0.23.0.html#commands.baseKeymap) no longer binds keys for `joinUp`, `joinDown`, `lift`, and `selectParentNode`.

### New features

New commands [`selectNodeForward`](https://prosemirror.net/docs/ref/version/0.23.0.html#commands.selectNodeForward) and [`selectNodeBackward`](https://prosemirror.net/docs/ref/version/0.23.0.html#commands.selectNodeBackward) added.

## 0.20.0 (2017-04-03)

### New features

The new [`selectAll` command](https://prosemirror.net/docs/ref/version/0.20.0.html#commands.selectAll), bound to Mod-a in the base keymap, sets the selection to an [`AllSelection`](https://prosemirror.net/docs/ref/version/0.20.0.html#state.AllSelection).

## 0.19.0 (2017-03-16)

### Bug fixes

Calling `joinBackward` at the start of a node that can't be joined no longer raises an error.

## 0.18.0 (2017-02-24)

### New features

New command [`splitBlockKeepMarks`](https://prosemirror.net/docs/ref/version/0.18.0.html#commands.splitBlockKeepMarks) which splits a block but preserves the marks at the cursor.

## 0.17.1 (2017-01-16)

### Bug fixes

Make sure [`toggleMark`](https://prosemirror.net/docs/ref/version/0.17.0.html#commands.toggleMark) also works in the top-level node (when it is a textblock).

## 0.17.0 (2017-01-05)

### Breaking changes

The `dispatch` function passed to commands is now passed a [`Transaction`](https://prosemirror.net/docs/ref/version/0.17.0.html#state.Transaction), not an action object.

## 0.15.0 (2016-12-10)

### Breaking changes

Drops suppport for `delete(Char|Word)(Before|After)` and `move(Back|For)ward`, since we are now letting the browser handle those natively.

### Bug fixes

The [`joinForward`](https://prosemirror.net/docs/ref/version/0.15.0.html#commands.joinForward) and [`joinBackward`](https://prosemirror.net/docs/ref/version/0.15.0.html#commands.joinBackward) commands can now strip out markup and nodes that aren't allowed in the joined node.

### New features

A new command [`exitCode`](https://prosemirror.net/docs/ref/version/0.15.0.html#commands.exitCode) allows a user to exit a code block by creating a new paragraph below it.

The [`joinForward`](https://prosemirror.net/docs/ref/version/0.15.0.html#commands.joinForward) and [`joinBackward`](https://prosemirror.net/docs/ref/version/0.15.0.html#commands.joinBackward) commands now use a bidirectional-text-aware way to determine whether the cursor is at the proper side of its parent textblock when they are passed a view.

## 0.13.0 (2016-11-11)

### New features

The [`autoJoin`](https://prosemirror.net/docs/ref/version/0.13.0.html#commands.autoJoin) function allows you to wrap command functions so that when the command makes nodes of a certain type occur next to each other, they are automatically joined.

## 0.12.0 (2016-10-21)

### Bug fixes

Fix crash when backspacing into nodes with complex content
expressions.

## 0.11.0 (2016-09-21)

### Breaking changes

Moved into a separate module.

The interface for command functions was changed to work with the new
[state](https://prosemirror.net/docs/ref/version/0.11.0.html#state.EditorState)/[action](https://prosemirror.net/docs/ref/version/0.11.0.html#state.Action) abstractions.
